What Needs to Change

  Currently, the game uses desktop-only controls (frontend/src/game/scenes/MainScene.ts):
  - Movement: WASD/Arrow keys (lines 158-168)
  - Aiming: Mouse position (line 174)
  - Shooting: Mouse click (lines 177-179)
  - Abilities: E key for shield (lines 84-87)

  Required Changes for Mobile

  1. Touch Movement Controls
    - Add a virtual joystick or directional buttons
    - Detect touch input instead of keyboard
  2. Touch Aiming & Shooting
    - Option A: Auto-aim at nearest enemy
    - Option B: Shoot in the direction you're moving
    - Option C: Add a second virtual joystick for aiming
    - Option D: Tap anywhere to aim and shoot
  3. Touch Ability Buttons
    - Add on-screen buttons for shield (E key) and pause (ESC)
  4. Additional Mobile Optimizations
    - Prevent default touch behaviors (zoom, scroll)
    - Adjust UI scaling for smaller screens
    - Consider performance optimizations for mobile devices
